## 1. Project Overview

* **Problem Statement:** Startups need to validate MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) quickly without complex server setups.

* **Solution:** A lightweight, responsive task manager that allows users to organize their daily work efficiently.

## 2. Features & Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** Responsive design and styling.
* **JavaScript:** Logic for adding, moving, and deleting tasks.
* **LocalStorage (Bonus):** Ensures data persistence so tasks remain after page refresh.

## 3. Web Infrastructure Theory

This section is critical for your "Infrastructure Understanding" marks.

### What happens when you type the URL?

1. **Browser (The Client):** The user enters the URL. The browser acts as the interface that sends a request to the internet.
2. **DNS (Domain Name System):** The internet uses DNS to translate the human-readable URL (like `github.io`) into a numerical IP address to find the server.
3. **Web Server:** The server (GitHub Pages) receives the request and locates the **Static Files** (HTML, CSS, JS) stored in the repository.
4. **HTTP Response:** The server sends these files back to the browser.
5. **Execution:** The browser renders the HTML/CSS and executes the JavaScript logic locally on the user's machine.

## 4. Deployment Process

* **Platform:** GitHub Pages.
* **Why:** I chose this platform because it provides a "traditional" static hosting environment that serves files directly from a version control system without the need for complex containerization like Docker.

* **Steps taken:**
1. Initialized a Git repository.
2. Pushed the source code to GitHub.
3. Enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings to make the site publicly accessible.

## 5. How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Umutoni2/task-manager-app`
2. Navigate to the folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser or use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
